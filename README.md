# AndroidStudio
Docker container to run AndroidStudio

I didn't want to install AS and its dependencies directly on my host. This has everything needed to run the app, connect
to the device, and run the adb server. Note - running the adb server requires a manual step from within the container
but adb is installed so it will work.
